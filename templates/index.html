        <p> This complex amalgamation of sounds provides a platform on which we can exercise a variety of the data science techniques we have learned this past semester. Music analysis is convenient because of the availability of a rich dataset, in two respects: the overwhelming amount of data that is available for each song (in terms of inherent and external characteristics, described in more detail later) and the existence of a vast number of songs. </p>

          <p >The current graph shows 443 songs from the intersection of the 7digital data and the playlist data (see below). The size of each dot is proportional to a popularity score (see below). MP3 preview files were taken from <a href='7digital.com'>7digital.com</a>. 
          <br/><br/>
          The sound waves which make up a specific song can be represented as a multi-dimensional vector. To better visualize these data, we reduced the dimensionality with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Each data point represents a song plotted on the first two principal components. (arbitrary units)</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>See for yourself</h2>
          <p >Hover over each song to listen to a preview. (Some preview clips may be softer and load more slowly.) Songs that are close together on the PCA plane should sound similar. Listen to songs on the extremes of each axis and note any differences or similarities. 
          <br/><br/>
          Click the genre labels to toggle the display of songs categorized in each genre by 7digital. Double click on the genre label to show songs solely from that genre. Start with hiding all genres except "punk" and "folk". These are the genres that are most distinct. </p>
        </div><!-- /.col-lg-4 -->
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>What it means</h2>
          <p >We noted that the first principal component (x-axis) represents a soft-to-rock variation. Songs at the left extreme of the axis sound more classical and soft, whereas those on the rightmost extreme sound more hard and rock. The second principal component (y-axis) seems to represent tempo variation. Songs at the bottom extreme of the axis sound slower, whereas those on the topmost extreme sound faster. 
          <br/><br/>
          Some sets of genres are more distinct than others. The most well-defined distinction was observed between songs classified as pop and those classifed as folk. These distinctions make intuitive sense from experience. Conversely, least well-defined distinction was observed between songs classified as R and B Soul and those classifed as Alternative Indie. These genres may very well be a product of culture - there is not inherent basis for classifying a song as either R and B Soul or Alternative Indie. </p>

          <p >Artists in the same modularity (calculated with Gephi) perfrom more often together. However, it was surprising that the genre categorizations did not appear clustered in the same netwrok. This may be because we have too many genre calssifications - some genres could really be grouped into one. This may point towards the fact that many artists choose to collaborate with others outside of thier genre. There seems to be two classes or popular artists. Some, such as Survivor, prefer to perform alone - they appear on the sides of the collaboration network. Others, such as The Black Eyed Peas, have performed with many other artists. It is interesting to note how these two styles can both accheive popularity.  </p>

This may be because we have too many genre calssifications - some genres could really be grouped into one. This may also point towards the fact that many user prefer to put songs of many different genres in a playlist. As expected, the most popular songs cluster in the middle because many user should all list them, and they would be linked to many other songs in many different playlists.

        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>Firstly, we have shown that we can determine some genres using inherent characteristics of song sound waves. With this method, the difference between some genres are more distictive than others. Secondly, we have explored artist interactions, showing that artist do not necessary cluster by genre as expected, and that popular artists may either choose to collaborate or be lone wolves. Lastly, we have shown that user prefer many different genres in their playlists and that popular songs are in the center of the user preference song network. 
        <p>This project can have many benefits. It can help artists and producers in the music industry produce songs that are more likely to be in the top 40 category, thus increasing revenue. This project can enhance current methods of categorizing and classifying songs, thus making music management/organization software more effective. And finally, it can help individuals find songs that will appeal to their tastes or moods, enhancing their listening experience like never before.</p>
